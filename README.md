# Kerning-with-controller

### **About**
This guide shows how to configure a controller to do kerning & spacing with it. It is inspired by [**Hugo Jourdan's**](https://github.com/HugoJourdan) [Kerning Controller Tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FtsCM5Hu08y_zwmhZrpfGrsRDGifYJr5KRW-ZlnIMwM/edit).

I use this method in Mac OS and Glyphs 3 but I believe this can be implemented in Windows and other font editors as well.

### **How to use**
1. You need a controller. It can be anything compatible with your OS. I'm using [this](https://www.powera.com/p/nintendo/nintendo-switch/controllers/wired/enhanced-wired-controller-for-nintendo-switch-purple-frost-1513054-01/).
2. If you don't have [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) installed on your computer. You need to download & install it.
3. Sign-in Steam, plug in your controller and go to **Steam > Preferences > General Controller Settings**
4. Select the best pre-set option for your controller. Go back

5. Back to **Preferences** window > **Desktop Configuration**. You will see the interface showing your controller's assigned buttons.

6. To change the default button assignments, click on one of the command names lined around the controller. Here I selected the button on the bottom left (L2 for PS, LT for Xbox, ZL for Nintendo)

7. Click on **Full Pull Action**

8. First **Remove** the assignment, (If that button will include multiple keys) **Toggle Multi-Button On**, and then assign the desired keys either by using a keyboard or mouse or controller. Go back

9. Change all the buttons according to your needs

10. When you are done with configuration > **Export Config > Save to Local or Cloud storage** You can save as many configurations as you want and apply them whenever you need them.

### **Button Setup**
My button setup is still under development. I like the experience of spacing & kerning by using the left stick more than just pressing the buttons.
